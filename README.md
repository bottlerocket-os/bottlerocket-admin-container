# Bottlerocket Admin Container

This is the default admin container for [Bottlerocket](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket).
The admin container has an SSH server that lets you log in as ec2-user using your EC2-registered SSH key.
It runs outside of Bottlerocket's container orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.

The admin container is disabled by default in Bottlerocket.
For more information about how the admin container fits into the Bottlerocket operating system, please see the [Bottlerocket documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/README.md#admin-container).

## Building the Container Image

You'll need Docker 17.06.2 or later, for multi-stage build support.
Then run `make`!

## Authenticating with the Admin Container

### Uploading user keys
Starting from v0.6.0, users have the option to pass in their own ssh keys rather than the admin container relying on the AWS instance metadata service (IMDS).

Users can add their own keys by populating the admin container's user-data with a base64-encoded JSON block.
If user-data is populated then Bottlerocket will not fetch from IMDS at all, but if user-data is not set then Bottlerocket will continue to use the keys from IMDS.

To use custom public keys for `.ssh/authorized_keys` and/or custom CA keys for `/etc/ssh/trusted_user_ca_keys.pub` you will want to generate a JSON-structure like this:

```
{
   "ssh":{
      "authorized-keys":[
         "ssh-rsa EXAMPLEAUTHORIZEDPUBLICKEYHERE my-key-pair"
      ],
      "trusted-user-ca-keys":[
         "ssh-rsa EXAMPLETRUSTEDCAPUBLICKEYHERE authority@ssh-ca.example.com"
      ]
   }
}
```

Once you've created your JSON, you'll need to base64-encode it and set it as the value of the admin host container's user-data setting in your [instance user data toml](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#using-user-data).

```
[settings.host-containers.admin]
# ex: echo '{"ssh":{"authorized-keys":[]}}' | base64
user-data = "eyJzc2giOnsiYXV0aG9yaXplZC1rZXlzIjpbXX19Cg=="
```

### EC2 instance connect

If your bottlerocket instance profile is [configured to allow EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-set-up.html#ec2-instance-connect-configure-IAM-role),
you can connect to the admin container (from 0.7.2).
